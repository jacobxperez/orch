## Compliance & Notes

- ✅ All scripts here must include correct frontmatter (`@license`, `@file`, `@title`, `@description`, `@version`)
- ✅ Follows rules from [`compliance.md`](../../maestro/docs/compliance.md) and [`checklist.md`](../../maestro/docs/checklist.md)
- ✅ No ad-hoc logic — everything routes through the utilities in `source/core/utils/`
