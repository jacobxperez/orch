# Business Source License 1.1 (Custom – No Auto-Conversion)

This Orch source code is made available under a customized version of the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL-1.1).  
It retains the non-commercial grant of the original license but **removes the automatic conversion clause** to ensure long-term protection of the Orch orchestration system.

## Quick Summary (Non-Binding)

This is a **non-commercial only** license.  
You can use this part of Orch™ for learning, research, experimentation, and open-source projects — but **not** for any production, business, hosted, or embedded use without a commercial license.

This license is based on the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL-1.1) but **removes the automatic conversion clause**, meaning it never becomes a permissive license over time.  
The Orch orchestration system remains under the author’s exclusive rights unless explicitly re-licensed in writing.

**If you want to use Orch in production or for business:**  
See [COMMERCIAL.md](./COMMERCIAL.md) for licensing options.

## License Duration

This license does **not** automatically convert to another license.  

All rights to Orch orchestration code remain exclusively with the author unless explicitly re-licensed in writing.

- You may not remove the Orch name or trademark from the source code or documentation.  
- You may not rebrand, rename, or redistribute Orch under another project identity.  
- You may not obfuscate, conceal, or wrap Orch’s orchestration graph in a way that disables introspection, agent observability, or traceability.
