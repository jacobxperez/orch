# Commercial Licensing for Orch

## Quick Overview

Orchâ€™s sealed orchestration runtime (`orch.wasm`) and internal orchestration code are licensed **non-commercial only** under the [BSL-1.1 (Custom â€“ No Auto-Conversion)](./LICENSE-BSL.md).  
If you want to **use Orch in production**, **inside a business**, or **integrated into proprietary products**, you **must obtain a commercial license**.

If your usage is limited to public API proxies in `orch/system/*` and you comply with the [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE-APACHE.md) terms, no commercial license is required.

## When You Need a Commercial License

You **must** obtain a commercial license if you use **any part of the Orch orchestration system** under these conditions:

- **Production Deployment** â€” Any Orch-powered application or service available to end users  
- **Internal Business Use** â€” Use within an organization that is not open-sourced in full  
- **Commercial Services** â€” Hosted platforms, SaaS products, developer tools, orchestration frameworks  
- **Integration into Proprietary Systems** â€” Embedding Orch into closed-source runtimes or frameworks  
- **Specialized Domains** â€” Robotics, blockchain, cryptographic execution layers, embedded hardware, hybrid or quantum orchestration  

If your usage **only** involves public API proxies in `orch/system/*` and complies with **Apache 2.0** terms, you do **not** need a commercial license.  
If you are using `orch.wasm` or internal orchestration code in a production or business context, you **do**.
